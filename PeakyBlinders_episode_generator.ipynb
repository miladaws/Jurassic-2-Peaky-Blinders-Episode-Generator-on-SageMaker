Tommy visits Mosley and demands that he release Billy. Mosley refuses, and Tommy shoots Mosley's men. Mosley escapes and Tommy is arrested. Esme visits Tommy in prison and tells him that Billy is dead. Tommy then breaks out of prison and goes to Scotland, where he meets with Jessie and tells her that he knows that she betrayed him to Mosley. Esme visits Tommy in Scotland and tells him that she has turned against Mosley and that he must return to Birmingham to face justice. Tommy agrees and returns to Birmingham with Esme, where Mosley has arranged for him to be tried by a military tribunal. The trial begins, and Tommy is acquitted of all charges. Michael, Polly, and Arthur are released from prison and reunite with Tommy and Esme. The Peaky Blinders disband, and Tommy and Esme go to America to start their new life together.\n"
