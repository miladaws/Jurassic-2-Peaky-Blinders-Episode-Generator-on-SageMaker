Winston Churchill sends Chief Inspector Chester Campbell of the Royal Irish Constabulary to Birmingham to retrieve the guns. Tommy's aunt Polly Gray urges Tommy to return the guns, but he feels that he can use them to his advantage. His brother Arthur Shelby does not agree with Tommy about fixing horse races, believing it will cause trouble with Billy Kimber, who runs the races. Inspector Campbell and his men capture Arthur and beat him while inquiring about the gun robbery. Inspector Campbell propositions Arthur and the gang to work with him to find the guns. Tommy's sister Ada Shelby is involved with Freddie Thorne, a communist. A barmaid named Grace Burgess starts working at the Garrison, a bar owned by the Peaky Blinders. She has been placed in Birmingham by Inspector Campbell to help find the guns. Tommy's friend Danny has a PTSD episode and kills an Italian business owner. To avoid a war with the Italians, Tommy agrees to kill Danny, with the Italians witnessing. However, Danny's death is faked and he goes to London on a special assignment."
1,2,,"Tommy, Arthur and their brother John Shelby meet with a rival Romanichal gang, the Lees, to look at a horse for the next race. The Lees insult the Peaky Blinders and a fight breaks out. Inspector Campbell's special force launches a surprise crackdown, targeting communists and looking for the guns. Freddie and Ada escape, but Freddie has to leave town. Inspector Campbell confronts Polly and attacks all the Peaky Blinder establishments. In retaliation, Tommy arranges for a reporter to write about a burning of the King's picture, which prompts Churchill to pressure Inspector Campbell. Tommy meets with Inspector Campbell and gives him an ultimatum: if the Peaky Blinders are left alone, he will return the guns; if Inspector Campbell interferes with his plans, Tommy will send the guns to the IRA and ruin Inspector Campbell's work in Belfast. Inspector Campbell agrees but instructs Grace to get close to Tommy and find the location of the guns. Polly realises Ada is pregnant and tells Tommy, who threatens to kill Freddie but then instructs him to take Ada away. Freddie instead proposes to Ada and decides to stay in town. Billy Kimber and his men confront the Peaky Blinders, but Tommy convinces them to join forces in fighting the Lees."
1,3,,"Ada and Freddie marry; Polly gives them money to leave the country. Despite Tommy's best efforts to keep the guns a secret, people keep finding out about them, including two IRA members. Grace overhears them trying to blackmail Tommy and follows one of them, but he attacks her. Grace manages to shoot her attacker dead in self-defence. Tommy warns Billy Kimber that the Lees will once again rob Billy Kimber's bookies at the races. Tommy brings Grace as his date to Cheltenham races in an attempt to distract Billy Kimber as well as convince him that he should hire the Peaky Blinders as his security. Billy Kimber agrees if he can have some time alone with Grace, to which Tommy agrees. At the last minute, he has a change of heart and claims that Grace is actually a prostitute with syphilis. Freddie decides Tommy is not going to scare him off and returns."
1,4,,"Tommy makes his business legitimate by obtaining a betting licence. Although he does not quite trust her and is suspicious of her, Tommy hires Grace as his secretary. John calls the gang together to tell them he wants to marry Lizzie Stark, a local prostitute. Tommy disapproves because he does not think Lizzie has given up her former profession. His suspicions are confirmed when he requests her services as a test and she agrees. The Lees rob the Peaky Blinders' gambling den as revenge for the Peaky Blinders having protected Billy Kimber's bookies at the races. Tommy decides to call a truce with the Lees so that he can have an ally against Billy Kimber and marries John to the Lees' daughter Esme to secure the agreement. Ada comes to the wedding but goes into labour soon after. Freddie comes to see the new baby but is arrested when he shows up."

An IRA member starts inquiring about the man Grace killed. Tommy and Grace kill the other IRA members.

The Peaky Blinders have a meeting in the kitchen, where Tommy, in a state of stress, orders the men to be on their best behaviour. Meanwhile, a refugee from Soviet Russia, named Anton Kaledin, makes contact with the Peaky Blinders, offering the code ""Constantine"" as confirmation for the money-exchange meeting with the young Grand Duchess Tatiana Petrovna. Tommy informs her that Kaledin provided the wrong code name, meaning the man must be killed.

Tommy makes a deal with the Soviets to ensure the guns on the train will be useless, negating the need to blow up the train and sabotaging the plan to plant evidence at the scene of the explosion incriminating the USSR, thus causing an international incident which would lead to the United Kingdom cutting off diplomatic relations with Russia.
